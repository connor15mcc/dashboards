# Dashboards
Creating many dashboards using flask for various projects

## Application Tracker
Creating a Python project to facilitate the tracking of applications in a shift away from Excel

### Motivations
Following my recruitment for Summer '22 during the Fall of 2021 (my junior year), I wanted to gain additional insight and clarity into the recruiting progress as well as gain experience with a large (r than leetcode) sized Python project.

### Eventual Goals
- [x] Ability to add new applications easily
- [x] Ability to edit the progress of existing applications
- [x] Ability to delete applications/trackers/events
- [x] Ability to control via webpage
- [ ] Display information on number of applications, success rate, breakdown of status, etc
- [ ] Ability to autogenerate cover letters
  - [ ] Find API/way to find HQ based on company names (or self supply)
  - [x] Ability to generate latex file systematically from parameters
- [ ] Ability to gain insight/data on the progression of applications on a large scale and extract to visualizations

### Tips
- You should create a `.env` file with `SECRET_KEY=your_key_here`
- Passing any arguments to `launch.py` will launch the program in debug mode

## Resumes

### This repository is responsible for the creation and updates to my resume and cover letter over the years
