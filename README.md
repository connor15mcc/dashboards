# application-tracker
Creating a Python project to facilitate the tracking of applications in a shift away from Excel

## Motivations
Following my recruitment for Summer '22 during the Fall of 2021 (my junior year), I wanted to gain additional insight and clarity into the recruiting progress as well as gain experience with a large (r than leetcode) sized Python project.

## Eventual Goals
- Ability to add new applications easily
- Ability to edit the progress of existing applications
- Ability to gain insight/data on the progression of applications on a large scale and extract to visualizations
- Ability to control via webpage
- Ability to autogenerate cover letters

## Tips
- You should create a `.env` file with `SECRET_KEY=your_key_here`
